Pedro served as Chief Operating Officer (COO) of DuckDB Labs from 2021 to 2023, scaling the company from a small research spinoff into a leading open-source database company. He transitioned to Principal Engineer to focus on core infrastructure development. His key contributions include the CSV Reader/Sniffer, DuckLake (an integrated data lake and catalog format), Arrow and ADBC integration (38x faster than ODBC), Enum/Dictionary encoding, ART Persistent Storage, the Extension framework, and the Python client.

He has published at VLDB and ICDE, the top peer-reviewed venues in database systems research. In 2019, he was a research intern at Microsoft Research in Redmond (DMX group), where he worked on JIT-compiled execution engines for SQL Server.
